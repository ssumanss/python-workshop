# Quick Start

A warm welcome to the **Python Programming Workshop**. Python is a programming language so before learning anything we have to setup the environment so we can practice the programs. Plebe install python 3 as given below.

## Installation

Programming languages are supposed to be learn on computers. Fortunately now we have apps that can be used to learn python on smartphone. Due to lockdown many faculty members don't have access to the computer. So this programme is designed such that it can be completed on the smartphone. 

#### Android Smartphone

Please install Pydroid 3 IDE(Integrated development environment) from the playstore using the following link
